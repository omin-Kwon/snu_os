# Operating Systems SNU 2024 Projects

http://csl.snu.ac.kr/courses/4190.307/2024-1/

This repository contains the projects I worked on for the Operating Systems course at SNU in 2024. Below is a summary of each project along with its objectives and descriptions.

## Project #1: Hello World, xv6

**Objective**: Set up the development environment and familiarize with xv6.

**Description**:

-   xv6 is an instructional OS developed by MIT, based on Unix version 6.
-   For this project, I set up xv6-riscv on a multi-core RISC-V machine.
-   Tasks included setting up the development environment on Linux or macOS and familiarizing myself with the project submission server.

## Project #2: System Calls

**Objective**: Understand the implementation of system calls in xv6.

**Description**:

-   System calls are the interfaces allowing user applications to request services from the OS kernel.
-   This project involved studying and implementing system calls within the xv6 operating system.

## Project #3: The EDF (Earliest Deadline First) Scheduler

**Objective**: Implement the EDF scheduler to learn about the scheduling subsystem of xv6.

**Description**:

-   The existing CPU scheduler in xv6 uses a simple round-robin policy.
-   In this project, I implemented the EDF scheduler, which is used in real-time systems to manage CPU scheduling based on task deadlines.

## Project #4: KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging)

**Objective**: Explore the virtual memory subsystem by implementing KSM.

**Description**:

-   KSM is a memory de-duplication feature that merges identical memory pages into a single shared page across multiple processes, saving memory.
-   This project involved implementing the KSM feature in the xv6 operating system.

## Project #5: FATty File System

**Objective**: Modify the file index structure of xv6 to resemble the FAT file system.

**Description**:

-   The FAT file system by Microsoft has a unique file index structure based on the File Allocation Table (FAT).
-   The goal of this project was to adapt the file system in xv6 to mimic the structure of the FAT system.

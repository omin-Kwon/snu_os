Project #5: FATty File System
Microsoft’s early FAT file system has a unique file index structure based on the File Allocation Table (FAT). The goal of this project is to implement the “FATty” file system, which modifies the file index structure of the existing xv6 file system to resemble that of the FAT file system.

Project #4: KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging)
KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging) is a memory de-duplication feature that enables the kernel to consolidate identical memory pages into a single shared page across multiple processes, thereby saving memory. The objective of this project is to explore the virtual memory subsystem of xv6 by implementing the KSM feature.

Project #3: The EDF (Earliest Deadline First) Scheduler
Currently, the CPU scheduler of xv6 uses a simple round-robin policy. The goal of this project is to understand the scheduling subsystem of xv6 by implementing the EDF (Earliest Deadline First) scheduler used in real-time systems.

Project #2: System calls
System calls are the interfaces that allow user applications to request various services from the operating system kernel. This project aims to understand how those system calls are implemented in xv6.

Project #1: Hello world, xv6
xv6 is an instructional operating system developed by MIT based on Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie’s Unix version 6 (v6). In this course, we will use xv6-riscv, a version recently ported to a multi-core RISC-V machine. The goal of this project is to set up your development environment on Linux or macOS and familiarize yourself with our project submission server.
